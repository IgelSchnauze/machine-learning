3d course, labs 

## task 1
just practice of using right project structure

## task 2
- regression with basic polinom func
- graph RMSE against max polinom degree

## task 3
- work with train-valid-test data
- basic func are combinations of 1/2/3 func from [sin(x), cos(x), ln(x), e^x, sqrt(x), x, x^2, x^3] 

## task 4
- polinomial regression + regularization with gradient descent method
- validation with lambda + graphs

## task 5
